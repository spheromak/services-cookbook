Services Library Cookbook

Sets up libraries for defining endpoints and serevicess ontop of etcd via chef

## Usage
For now the [test/cookbooks/services_test/recipes/client.rb] can be used for a refrence.
More documentation to come.

## Future

I intend to move this library into a gem, but this was the quick route for now.
